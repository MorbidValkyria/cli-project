# cli-project
Command Line Interface written in NodeJS. 

## Running

You will have to run:
```shell
npm init
```

and 
```shell
npm link
```

To get started.

Most of the project is incomplete.


I want to give credits to [Dominik Kundel](https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/dkundel "Dominik Kundel's Homepage") as I used his [tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/blog/how-to-build-a-cli-with-node-js "How to build a CLI with Node.js") to get myself started.
